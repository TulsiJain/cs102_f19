Once you complete the activity, download it in PDF format:
_File -> Download As ... -> PDF Document (pdf)_

The completed PDF file should be submitted to Gradescope for grading (only one person from your group needs to submit the activity; you will have a chance to enter the names of all group members once you upload the file).

Here are quick steps for uploading to Gradescope:

* Go to [gradescope.com](http://gradescope.com) and log in with you NYU email address (the version that contains your NetID).
* On your Courses page, select the course for which youâ€™re submitting work.
* On your Courses page, you will see all of your current assignments. Click on the assignment you are turning in.
* _Click Submit PDF > Click Select PDF > locate the correct file on your computer > Click Upload PDF_
* (When activity has multiple parts) Tell us which pages correspond to each part/question on the assignment. You will see a list of all the assigned parts/questions, and images of all your document pages. For each question click the page(s) that contains your answer.
* Finally, __add the group members to the submission__: on the right hand side under the name of the person who submitted the assignment, you should see "Add Group Members" link. Use it to add up to 3 more student names to the submission. (__If you skip this step the other group members won't get credit for their work.__)

__Make sure that you add all of your group members to the submission on Gradescope__ - it is not enough to have their names in the pdf.
