__Extra credit__ (due Sept. 29 ):

(This should be done individually, not as a group activity.)

The following program attempts to read two numbers from the command line
(specified as the command line arguments to the program) and calculate their sum.
It turns out this program ignores possibility of many errors. If you submit it
to the autograder on Gradescope, you will see that it fails most of the tests.

- [Add.java](hwk/Add.java)

You task is to fix the code so that it passes all of the test.
This time around, you can see all of the feedback from the autograder, so you can
work with that. But, it is a better idea to try to fix it on your own and only
when you are certain that it handles all the possible problems, submit it to be
tested.
